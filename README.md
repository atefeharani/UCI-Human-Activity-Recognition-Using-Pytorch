# Human Activity Recognition Using Pytorch


Implement Human Activity Recognition in PyTorch using RNN, CNN, and CNN-LSTM Models on UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Dataset using Pytorch.
The types of movements are classified into six categories including:

0: walking

1: walking_upstairs

2: walking_downstairs

3: sitting

4: standing

5: laying


Let's use Pytorch that demonstrates the usages of RNN, CNN, and LSTM models to process sequential and ime series data.
