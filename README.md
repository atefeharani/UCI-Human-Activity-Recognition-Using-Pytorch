# Human Activity Recognition Using Pytorch


Implement Human Activity Recognition in PyTorch using a CNN-LSTM Model on UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Dataset using Pytorch.
The types of movements are classified into six categories including:

0: walking

1: walking_upstairs

2: walking_downstairs

3: sitting

4: standing

5: laying


Let's use Pytorch that demonstrates the usages of CNN, and LSTM models to process sequential and ime series data. In the following video, you can see the 6 activities recorded with one of the participants in the experiment:
